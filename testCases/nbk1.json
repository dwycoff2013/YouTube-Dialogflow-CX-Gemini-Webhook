        "text": [ "I'm sorry to hear that you're in need of bankruptcy assistance. I can provide you with some information and resources to help you get started. First, you'll need to determine which type of bankruptcy is right for you. There are two main types of bankruptcy for individuals: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, which means that your nonexempt property will be sold to pay off your debts. Chapter 13 is a reorganization bankruptcy, which allows you to create a plan to repay your debts over a period of time. Once you've determined which type of bankruptcy is right for you, you'll need to file a petition with the bankruptcy court. The petition will include information about your income, assets, and debts. You'll also need to file a plan if you're filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. After you've filed your petition, the court will hold a meeting of creditors. At this meeting, your creditors will have an opportunity to question you about your bankruptcy filing. The court will then decide whether to grant your discharge. If your discharge is granted, you'll be released from your debts. However, there are some debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, such as student loans and child support. If you're considering filing for bankruptcy, it's important to speak with an attorney to discuss your options. An attorney can help you determine which type of bankruptcy is right for you and can help you prepare your petition." ],
